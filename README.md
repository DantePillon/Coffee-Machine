# Coffee-Machine
During my Revision, I created 2 versions of a mock Coffee Machine software in Java as part of my study using Hyperskill (JetBrains Academy). One version attempts to make use of no OOP functionality, and the other attempts to use it well (I hope I used it well).

Message from later Dante: I want to write that I think this project was really good at helping me to understand the point of OOP since it was a bit more hand-holding than some others which I think is the correct way to help a learner apply their newfound knowledge. Thank you Jetbrains.
